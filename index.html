        <h1>Career</h1>
        <p>As Zev Love X,[16] Dumile formed the hip hop group KMD in 1988 with his younger brother DJ Subroc and Rodan, who was later replaced by Onyx the Birthstone Kid.[17] A&R representative Dante Ross learned of KMD through the hip hop group 3rd Bass and signed them to Elektra Records.[18] Their recording debut came on 3rd Bass's song "The Gas Face" on The Cactus Album,[17] followed in 1991 by their debut album Mr. Hood. Dumile performed the last verse on "The Gas Face"; according to Pete Nice's verse on the track, Dumile created the phrase.[19]

            On April 23, 1993, just before the release of the second KMD album, Black Bastards,[17] Subroc was struck by a car and killed while crossing the Long Island Expressway.[20][21] Dumile completed the album alone over the course of several months, and it was announced with a release date of May 3, 1994.[22] KMD was dropped by Elektra and the album went unreleased due to its controversial cover art,[18] which featured a cartoon of a stereotypical pickaninny or sambo character being hanged.[23]
            
            After his brother's death, Dumile retreated from the hip hop scene from 1994 to 1997, living "damn near homeless, walking the streets of Manhattan, sleeping on benches".[24] In the late 1990s, he settled in Atlanta; he had moved to Georgia in the mid-90s.[1] According to interviews with Dumile, he was "recovering from his wounds" and swearing revenge "against the industry that so badly deformed him".[17] Black Bastards had been bootlegged by that time,[23] but was not officially released until 2000.[25]</p>
